## üéØ Project Portfolio

### üè¶ Project 1: Financial Risk Assessment using Value at Risk (VaR)

- **Industry Focus**: Financial Risk Management
- **Objective**: Calculate **1-Day 95% Value at Risk** for a diversified equity portfolio comprising AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and AMZN
- **Methodologies**: Logarithmic return analysis, parametric modeling (normal & t-distributions), historical simulation, statistical hypothesis testing
- **Key Findings**: Achieved robust portfolio risk quantification (2.89-3.07%) with clear diversification benefits validated through backtesting

---

### üìà Project 2: Conversion Rate Optimization through A/B Testing

- **Industry Focus**: Digital Marketing & Business Intelligence
- **Objective**: Evaluate conversion rate performance between two website variants to identify statistically significant improvements
- **Methodologies**: Synthetic data generation, Z-proportion testing, confidence interval construction, sequential monitoring protocols
- **Key Findings**: Variant B demonstrated superior performance with **2.33% conversion rate improvement** over Variant A

### üìû Project 3: Call Center Workforce Optimization

- **Industry Focus**: Operations Research & Customer Experience
- **Objective**: Develop simulation models to optimize agent staffing levels while minimizing customer wait times
- **Methodologies**: Queuing theory implementation (Poisson arrival processes, exponential service distributions), M/M/s queueing models, cost-benefit optimization
- **Key Findings**: Determined optimal staffing configuration where 5 agents achieve sub-5-minute average wait times while balancing operational costs

---

### üè• Project 4: Clinical Trial Efficacy Analysis

- **Industry Focus**: Healthcare & Biostatistics
- **Objective**: Evaluate treatment effectiveness through comprehensive survival analysis of patient outcomes
- **Methodologies**: Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, Log-Rank statistical testing, Cox Proportional Hazards regression, competing risks modeling
- **Key Findings**: While treatment effects were non-significant, **cell type classification and Karnofsky performance score** emerged as critical survival predictors

---

### üè≠ Project 5: Statistical Process Control in Manufacturing

- **Industry Focus**: Manufacturing Quality Assurance
- **Objective**: Implement real-time quality monitoring systems to detect production anomalies using control charts
- **Methodologies**: P-control charts, CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) control, EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average), process capability analysis (Cp index)
- **Key Findings**: Successfully identified quality degradation (defect rate increase from 5% to 8%) with poor process capability (Cp = 0.4476) requiring immediate intervention

---

### üèè Project 6: IPL Performance Analytics (2008-2023)

- **Industry Focus**: Sports Analytics & Performance Metrics
- **Objective**: Investigate performance differentials between regular season and playoff matches in Indian Premier League cricket
- **Methodologies**: Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk), non-parametric analysis (Mann-Whitney U), distribution visualization (violin plots), regression modeling
- **Key Findings**: Revealed **consistent performance patterns** across match types with no statistically significant differences between league and playoff phases

---

### üó≥Ô∏è Project 7: Electoral Trends Analysis (1977-2014)

- **Industry Focus**: Political Science & Demographic Analytics
- **Objective**: Examine Indian electoral patterns focusing on voter participation, gender representation, and party dynamics
- **Methodologies**: ANOVA for group comparisons, correlation analysis, inequality measurement (Gini coefficient), comprehensive data visualization
- **Key Findings**: Identified persistent gender imbalances in candidate representation, though female candidates showed higher success rates; documented increasing electoral competitiveness over time

---
